# connect-4

Welcome to the Connect => 4 game

The game is 2-player and is played with the same rules as the original - except for yellow doesn't always play first. This is decided by a virtual coin flip on each game.

Players must click on their chosen column to place a token. During the game, the player graphics will indicate the player whose turn it is.

If a winning move is made, the winning "connect-4" will be highlighted and the gameboard reset after 5 seconds of celebration.
